x is an iOS application that allows you to have a tinder-esque swipe feature to find roommates for student housing. 

## Objective

Finding roommates using websites, or the university's official FaceBook page is just a lot of work. With the keyword filtering, the embarrasment trying to talk about yourself in order to find a decent enough roommate to live with for an entire academic year. 

Alternatively, x is an app that allows you to skip all these hurdles and use a well-known app that most college students already probably use: Tinder. 

x allows all users to put in their preferences for a roommate and has a swiping feature that lets you swipe through a pool of other college students like yourself who looking for roommates as well.
